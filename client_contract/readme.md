#Vagabond App

##Brief

We have been commissioned to build a travel community, codenamed Vagabond for now, for users to share tips (aka logs) on their favorite locations around the world.

##Client Contract

The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories. In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete.

* Always **pair** when writing code
* **Scrum** in the mornings and regularly checkin throughout the day
	* Clearly communicate current status & next steps
    * Use a kanban-style scrumb board such as trello to organize tasks
        * [Example Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/dl7VicOR/project-vagabond)
* **Commit** changes at least once for each user story
* Put effort into your **design**. Use:
	* A CSS framework
	* Partials
	* Custom CSS or Sass/Less
* Consider implementing **TDD** for any significantly complex application behavior.
* **Refactor** your code after each sprint, considering:

	* Indentation
	* Readability

## Questions to Ask yourself...

**Are you all clear about what the client wants?**

  * Identify vague areas.
  * Do you feel confident in your interpretation of their vision? If not, seek clarification.

**What will the UI flow be?**

* Hammer out any areas of ambiguity in the wireframes

**Which models do need to be implemented?**

  * Create an ERD for the client to reference.

**What are the major milestones or components that need to be completed?**

  * How can these be turned into tasks that group members can complete in pairs?
  * Where do these milestones overlap and how those related tasks be managed?

**What milestones are you and your group members interested in working on?**

  * How can you effectively delegate the work into pairs so that each group member is interested, challenged, and productive?
